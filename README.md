## User Stories

- As a user, I should be able to use a search bar and search button to search for products by clicking the search button or pressing enter on the keyboard. 

- As a user, I should see different product results based on search parameters.

- As a user, I should be able to navigate from page to page to see additional product results. 

- As a user, I should not see the previous button on the first page and the next button on the final page.

- As a user, I should be able to add items to my cart.

- As a user, I should be able to remove items from my cart.

- As a user, I should be able to confirm my purchase for the items in my cart.

## Context and Features

- WWW allows users to explore thousands of products from around the world. Upon page load, the user is met with a home page advertising some of our hottest Black Friday sales. The navigation bar contains an application logo (which conveniently links back to the home page), a link to the ABOUT US page, a search box, and a link to the user’s cart. The user is able to type any term into the search box and results will return based on the term. If there are no results for the term, a message will display informing the user. After receiving search results, the user is able to navigate between pages of results using forward and back buttons that display page locations. Every item on the page has a `Add To Cart` button. When the user clicks this button, it will be added to their cart. On the Cart page the user is able to see the total for the items they added to the cart, remove items from the cart, and confirm item purchases.  
 
- The application was designed from the ground up with the integration of Searchspring’s Search API in mind.  The data organization, pagination features, and search term parameters make the experience of searching for clothing items on WWW fast, efficient, and easy to use. Our founder Michael Harrison is very thankful for the eCommerce optimization tools provided by Searchspring, without which WWW would not be possible. 

## Future Features

Some future features I’d like to add to this application are:

- An individual product page with additional product details (description, colors available, sizes, etc.).
- Being able to retain cart items upon refresh with custom API or local storage.
- More extensive pagination features, including visible page numbers.
